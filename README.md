# ProductApp

This project was generated using [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 19.1.2.

## Configuration

Before starting application locally go to the folder `/src/environments` and create a copy of `environment.ts` file and rename it to `environment.development.ts`.

In this newly created file provide proper `API_KEY` and `API_URL`. 

## Development server

To start a local development server, run:

```bash
ng serve
```

Once the server is running, open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload whenever you modify any of the source files.

## Building

To build the project run:

```bash
ng build
```

This will compile your project and store the build artifacts in the `dist/` directory. By default, the production build optimizes your application for performance and speed.
